# WORTH
Final project for the Computer Networks course [@Unipisa](https://github.com/Unipisa)

Worth is a tool for the management of collaborative projects that is inspired by some principles of the Kanban methodology. The latter is an "agile" management method of a set of activities that allows you to monitor their evolution through a view of the phases of the project.
The service provide functionality for the creation and management of projects consisting of a series of activities, which we will call "cards", to be completed. Plus every project has a chat that can only be used by members of the same.
The service was implemented according to a client-server architecture, with components that communicate using the different technologies seen during the Computer Networks course, such as TCP, UDP and RMI.
